# Contributing

While this is my template repo for projects, I am always up for improving it.

While my main goal is to be able to spin up repos quickly. I also want to leverage this for learning. With that I am looking to explain the existing of each item within the repo.

## Questions

If you have questions that are not explained via documentation, please [create an issue](./issues).

## Suggestions

I appreciate you!
