# Kyle's Node Template Repo

This is the bare basics repo used when I want to start a new project.

## Includes

### `README.md`

Necessary for an good project to include a place to document what is it and why it is.

You need proof? Well, you are reading it now.

### `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

Sets the tone for how to treat others within the community related to this repo.

### `LICENSE`

Explains who can and cannot use this and sets up legal expectations.

### `CONTRIBUTING.md`

It is always good to document what sort of contributions are welcome and how they should be done.

This is also a good place to explain how to work within the repo.

### `package.json`

Since this is a node starter, I have a simple package.json with some of my details as well as other configuration that I expect for every project.

### `.gitignore`

Got to keep the repo clean.
